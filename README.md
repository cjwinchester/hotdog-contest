# ðŸŒ­ðŸŒ­ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤® Nathans Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest scraper
Some Python to scrape a list of winners of the annual Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest into a CSV, from 2002-present.

## Procedure To Run It!
I'm using `pipenv` to manage things, but you can use your tooling of choice.

1. Clone or download this repository
2. `cd` into the directory
3. `pipenv install`
4. `pipenv run python scrape.py`

## Known issues
The contest moved from co-ed to gender-separate in 2011, so not every contest has gender information.

Meredith Boxberger's results in 2016 do not include her total, but according to an email from Sam Barclay at" Major League Eating", the sanctioning body for the event, she finished 15.5 hot dogs and buns that year.
